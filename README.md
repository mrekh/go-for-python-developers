# Go (Golang) for Python developers ðŸš€
This project is inspired by the [Golang for Node.js developers](https://github.com/miguelmota/golang-for-nodejs-developers/) project. Similar to that project, I will do my best to provide numerous examples for those who are familiar with Python and are interested in learning Go.
Personally, my journey is similar to yours. I started with Python and later became drawn to this delightful and efficient language :)
